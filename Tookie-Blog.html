    <h3>A Day In the Life of Tookie</h3>
    <p>Tookie's day starts by waking her mom up at 6:30am for breakfast. 
      After snarfing down every last bit of food, Tookie enjoys a brief siesta
      for around 3 hours. When she is well digested and well rested, it's time for a 
      bit of exploration. She nags and nags until her mom agrees to take her 
      for a walk around the neighborhood. Upon her return it is time for her second 
      siesta... another 3 hours down! After that she passes the time by barking at
      any noise, in particular that of a UPS truck or mail-person. Dinner time! More 
      scarfing, sometimes some barfing, what a day it has been!
